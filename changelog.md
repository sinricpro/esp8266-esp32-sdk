# Changelog
## Version 2.9.9
- Fixed include instruction in EventLimiter.h (uppercase / lowercase issue)

## Version 2.9.8
- Fixed SinricProBlinds

## Version 2.9.7
- Fixed SinricProDimSwitch (include order)

## Version 2.9.6
### New
- Namespace implemented
  Each version gets its own namespace in the form of SINRICPRO_X_Y_Z (SINRICPRO_2_9_6)
- SinricProDevice: implemented registerRequestHandler (used by capabilities to register their requestHandler functions)
- Implemented SinricProStrings to avoid unnecessary string duplication and move the strings into PROGMEM.
- New temperature sensors example added HTU21D & AHT10 (thanks to [jpa-welten](https://github.com/jpa-welten))
### Changes
- Removed types: `DeviceId`, `AppKey` and `AppSecret`. These are now again of type `String`.
- Include guard is now based on `#pragma once` instead of `#ifndef`, `#define` and `#endif`
- Event-Limiting system changed\
Attempting to send events shorter than these minimum waiting times will add the minimum waiting time as a delay to each attempt. If excessive events are tried to be sent (e.g. in a loop) a warning is displayed.

### Code cleanup
- Moved callback definitions outside from class definitions\
(possible by the use of a dedicated namespace)
- Static-Cast (CRTP) unified to Pointer.

## Version 2.9.5
- Fixed: SinricProPowerSensor was missing PowerStateController
- Improved: Improved error message when a callback is not implemented

## Version 2.9.4
- Fixed: Compiler error on libb64/cencode.h when ESP8266WebServer is included before SinricPro.h.

## Version 2.9.3
- RangeController accepts callbacks for integer and floating point values
- Event limitation takes into account different instances for generic controllers 
- SettingController implemented for future use

## Version 2.9.2
- Removed external crypto libraries
- Changed & fixed signature calculation
- use std::bind instead lambda functions for member callbacks (SinricProWesockets.h)

## Version 2.9.1
Bugfix
- SinricProTemperatureSensor (fixed wrong include)
- SinricProWindowAC (fixed copy & paste error)
- SinricProDevice (getDeviceId was accedently proteced)

## Version 2.9.0
New:
- support custom devices
- check for minimum websockets version

Fixed:
- MultiRelays example

## Version 2.8.1
- New Example: MultiRelays_advance (see examples/Relay)
- Moved existing relay example to new folder (examples/Relay)

## Version 2.8.0
- SSL is now enabled by default

## Version 2.7.6

  removed QueueList.h and use std::queue instead

## Version 2.7.5
- New Examples 
  - Examples / Light / RGB_LED_Stripe_5050
  - Examples / Switch / Relay

## Version 2.7.4
- New
  - Speaker & TV `onAdjustVolume` callback changed:
    The new format is `bool onAdjustVolume(const String &deviceId, int &volumeDelta, bool volumeDefault);`
    `volumeDefault`: `false` if the user specified the amount by which to change the volume; otherwise `true`

## Version 2.7.3
Fixed
- `.c_str()` for AppKey, AppSecret and DeviceId return now a valid `const char*`

## Version 2.7.2
Fixed:
- The examples are now located in subfolders if more than one example is provided

## Version 2.7.1
Fixed:
- Switch example
  `SinricProDevice.getDeviceId()` returns `SinricProId` instead of `char*` since version 2.7.0

## Version 2.7.0
New:
- Added new classes for AppKey, AppSecret and DeviceId
  This allows to store credentials efficiently in EEPROM and reduces the internal RAM usage
  
- Added function to measure the RTT between device and SinricPro Server (SinricPro.onPong())

Fixed:
- Type mismatches in Crypto.h / Crypto.cpp (to reduce compiler warnings)
